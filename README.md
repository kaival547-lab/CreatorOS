I’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as Software Developer at my on saas! Today I’m sharing something I’ve been quietly building 👇
Creator OS — my first AI-powered SaaS web app.
Creators lose money not because they lack talent…
 but because deals get messy:
 • missed follow-ups
 • unclear briefs
 • wrong pricing
 • brand DMs scattered everywhere
So I built Creator OS to fix that.
